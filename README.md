# Lunar Cycles and Crypto Market Dynamics
**An Empirical Study on ETH, SOL, and BNB (2025)**

## Overview  
This repository hosts the research paper *“Lunar Cycles and Crypto Market Dynamics: An Empirical Study on ETH, SOL, and BNB”*.  
The study explores whether **lunar phases (Full Moons & New Moons)** have a measurable correlation with short-term price dynamics of three major crypto assets: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Binance Coin (BNB).  

The motivation behind this work is to better understand how **market psychology and collective narratives** can create real, repeatable effects on financial markets.  

## Abstract (Summary)  
- **Dataset**: 16 lunar events (8 Full Moons + 8 New Moons, Jan–Aug 2025)  
- **Methodology**: analyzed intraday moves (Open → High/Low) and calculated *maximum safe leverage* thresholds  
- **Findings**:  
  - 100% of lunar events showed **positive intraday pumps** 📈  
  - **Full Moons** → stronger upside but higher risk (ETH +8%, SOL +10%, BNB +9.7%)  
  - **New Moons** → smaller but steadier gains  
  - Safe leverage caps: **ETH ~9×**, **SOL ~10×**, **BNB ~12×**  
- **Interpretation**: This isn’t astrology. It’s a **self-fulfilling prophecy** — traders believe lunar cycles matter, they act accordingly, and the belief itself moves the market.  

## Key Results  
- **Ethereum (ETH)**: consistent positive moves, but sensitive to deep drawdowns → conservative leverage recommended.  
- **Solana (SOL)**: strongest pumps observed, but with high volatility.  
- **Binance Coin (BNB)**: most resilient asset, with shallow drawdowns and highest safe leverage margins.
